# Disable Resample script for Sony Vegas
Put the `Disable Resample.cs` file into the Script Menu folder (e.g. `%ProgramFiles%\Sony\Vegas Pro 13.0\Script Menu`).

After restarting Sony Vegas you should have a new option at *Tools>Scripting>Disable Resample*.
## Info
If you're using Magix Vegas, then you can go into the *Project Properties* and change the *Resample mode* without needing this script.
